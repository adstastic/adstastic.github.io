Quoting [Jan](https://janklug.substack.com/p/daikokuten):

> That’s what I don’t get about the folks out west - if you blast someone from a storm cloud for being human on a particularly stupid day, how the heck are they supposed to learn? Scare ‘em straight, I say!

> Don’t look so worried. Yes the pot-bellied, laughing drinking buddy to Ebisu you just tossed your coins and bowed to hoping for success or love has been, and will always be, an inexorable cosmic force that will annihilate everything in existence but you know what? It’s not personal! If I don’t give a whit if you’re an emperor or a black hole, do you really think I’m here to ruin your life in particular? Cut me some slack!

> The spring that arrives when you’re at your most worn out from winter comes whether you remember or believe it will.
