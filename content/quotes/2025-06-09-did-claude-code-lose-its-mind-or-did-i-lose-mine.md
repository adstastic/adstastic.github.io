Quoting [Jon Stokes](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/did-claude-code-lose-its-mind-or):

> Again, I had forgotten that I had done this already in a previous session. I simply had no memory of it whatsoever, probably *because I didn’t write it*.

> Somewhere in the previous few weeks, I had started to relate to the bot as a junior programmer that I had a sort of mind-meld with, where I could speak to it in shorthand and not spell everything out. And as I began to relate to Claude Code this way, I started to relax my vigilance, take shortcuts, skip steps, and generally abandon the process that had worked so well early on.

I was unintentionally giving the bot bigger and bigger bites to chew on, with less and less active direction and focused oversight. And as I was slowly slipping into this mode with Claude, I was getting more and more frustrated with the output.

> I had gotten comfortable, lazy, and overconfident in the model’s capabilities, and as I did that, the output quality started to collapse.
