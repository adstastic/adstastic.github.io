Quoting [Linda Caroll](https://lindac.substack.com/p/the-best-writing-tip-ive-ever-read?r=5lwff8&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true):

> “Write about small, self-contained incidents that are still vivid in your memory. If you remember them, it's because they contain a larger truth that your readers will recognize in their own lives. Think small and you'll wind up finding the big”  
― William Zinsser
