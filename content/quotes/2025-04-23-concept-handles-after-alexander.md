Quoting [Scott Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3b7sidNrEkNaY9qfGwZjwz):

> A “concept handle” is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic. For example: “prisoner’s dilemma,” “Overton window,” “belief in belief,” etc.

> Successful concept handles can really amplify a vague idea which many people sort of understand but can’t point to and talk about. If you give that vague notion a crisp, catchy name, you can unlock a lot of conversation and reflection.
