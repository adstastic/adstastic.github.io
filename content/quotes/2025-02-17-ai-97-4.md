Quoting [Zvi Mowshowitz](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-97-4):

> The good things do feel great, the problem is that they donâ€™t feel better prospectively, before you do them. So you need a way to fix this alignment problem, in two ways. You need to figure out what the good things are, and motivate yourself to do them.

> Since editing is part of writing, that reduces to: why bother to write when the AI will do it for you? And since writing is thinking, that reduces in turn to: why bother to think when the AI will do it for you?
