Quoting [Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-fusion-race):

> Imagine a bizarro relay marathon in which one runner carries the baton for the first 26.0 miles, opens up a backpack full of batons, and hands them out liberally to a waiting horde of sprinters to dash all-out for the final 0.2 miles. That’s the best analogy we can come up with for this moment in the Fusion Race.

> which old sci-fi predictions from the first half of the 20th Century came true, and which didn’t. The answer depended on those predictions’ energy intensity.<br>Where is My Flying Car?<br>Innovations that don’t consume a lot of energy – those in the world of bits – mostly came true. Innovations that do require a lot of energy – those in the world of atoms – did not.
