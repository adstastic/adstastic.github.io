Quoting [Zvi Mowshowitz](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/o3-oh-my):

> With O3 costing (potentially) $2,000 per task on “high compute,” the app layer is needed more than ever.For example, giving the wrong context to it and you just burned $1,000.Likely, we have a mix of models based on their pricing/intelligence at the app layer, prepping the data to feed it into O3.100% worth the money but the last thing u wana do is send the wrong info lol
