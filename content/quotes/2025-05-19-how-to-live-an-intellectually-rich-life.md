Quoting [Utsav Mamoria](https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich?r=5lwff8&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true):

> Zhangâ€™s work was never about the hustle culture which envelopes and consumes us, just like the swallowing trees of Moradoom do. His routine is a beautiful poem, pithy with a clear message - Consistency over Flashes of Brilliance. Repeatability over Spontaneous Genius.

> if we are to stop and observe the cadence of our lives, we will notice the patterns - How responsibilities pile up around certain times of the day/week/month or year. How we are repeatedly making predictable, poor choices, taking suboptimal decisions consistently.

All of these can be navigated with the oars of routine.

> Routines are amazing in one single way - They take away the need to make decisions. Decisions about mundane things, which need to be made in a short amount of time. Our dopamine hungry, stress addled brains are being asked to do too much, too often. A carefully crafted routine will free up both physical time and mental space to allow for our curiosity to thrive.

> getting off your peak would mean going through the discomfort of abandoning all notions of knowledge, and being willing to become a student again. You will need to accept that you know nothing about this new peak.

> Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one&#39;s self-esteem.

That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily; and why older persons, especially if vain or important, cannot learn at all.

> As we come down, and shed our views, we start seeing our field of knowledge more objectively, and understand that there are limits to our thinking, even though we are experts.

> Once we have stripped ourselves of our views, and contemplated, we isolate ourselves from our Ego. This act of isolation humbles us, makes us realise our follies and helps us see illusions we have lived under.

> He would typically show up at a colleague&#39;s doorstep and announce &#34;my brain is open&#34;, staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.

> Write for no one but yourself. The act of writing forces you to think clearly. It makes you commit your ideas to paper in a logical flow. It allows you to make connections you did not see earlier. It allows you to come up with ideas that seemed implausible. Writing is emergence, of the ideas and the self.
