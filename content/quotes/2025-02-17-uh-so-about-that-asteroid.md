Quoting [Interconnected](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/14/asteroid):

> The irony of *all this* would be if we’re able to reallocate sufficient global GDP for a rush mission to deflect a planet-killer asteroid in 2028 ONLY BECAUSE the world’s largest economy has been hijacked by a space-fixated profit-motivated hyper-authoritarian industrialist.

Don’t know about you but I’d take that as solid proof of interfering benevolent time travellers.
