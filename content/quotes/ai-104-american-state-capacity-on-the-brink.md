Quoting [Zvi Mowshowitz](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-104-american-state-capacity-on):

> Once, ppl believed eval results would shock lawmakers into action or give Safety credibility w/o building societal consensus, but, I repeat, THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC RESULT THAT WILL DO THE ADVOCACY WORK FOR US.

People simply know too little about frontier AI and there is simply too little precedent for AI risks in our laws and society for scientific findings in this area to speak for themselves. They have to come with recommendations and policies and enforcement attached.
