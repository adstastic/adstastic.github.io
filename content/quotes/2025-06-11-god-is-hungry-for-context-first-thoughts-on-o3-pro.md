Quoting [Ben Hylak](https://www.latent.space/p/o3-pro):

> the problem with evaluating o3 pro.

It’s smarter. *much smarter.*

**But in order to see that, you need to give it** ***a lot*** **more context. and I’m running out of context.**

There was no simple test or question i could ask it that blew me away.

But then I took a different approach. My co-founder Alexis and I took the the time to assemble a history of all of our past planning meetings at Raindrop, all of our goals, even record voice memos: and then asked o3-pro to come up with a plan.

We were blown away; it spit out the exact kind of concrete plan and analysis I’ve always wanted an LLM to create — complete with target metrics, timelines, what to prioritize, and strict instructions on what to absolutely cut.

The plan o3 gave us was plausible, reasonable; but the plan o3 Pro gave us was specific and rooted enough that ***it actually changed how we are thinking about our future.***

This is hard to capture in an eval.
