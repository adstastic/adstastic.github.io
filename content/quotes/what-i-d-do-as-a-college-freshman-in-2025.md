Quoting [Blogger](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/04/what-id-do-as-college-freshman.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter):

> Being supported by AI tools is [not a substitute for mastery](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/03/master-your-tools.html). You can’t borrow skills. You have to earn them.

> We're heading into the age of π-shaped people: depth in two areas, and [generalist across](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2019/06/book-review-range-why-generalists.html  ). Building depth first, and then ranging is [good strategy](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/01/recent-reads.html).

> Clear communication matters more than ever:

•   for working with others (especially remotely)
•   for building in the open
•   for working with LLMs.

> Management skills matters too. Not just for leading teams, but also for leading yourself. Self-help book gets mocked, but they are useful for the querying/investigating they ignite in you, rather than their vacuous/repetitive advice. Know yourself. Then [fool yourself](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2016/01/fool-yourself.html) into greatness.

> You don’t need a title to lead teams. Influence scales from the bottom. You have more leverage and autonomy than you realize, especially early in your career.

> Credentialism is fading, but community isn't. College is still the best place to meet smart people, get inspired, and build with peers. Don't waste it competing and just following lectures. Learn from each other. Take initiative. Start things.

> Effectual thinking is messy yet powerful. It starts with what you have. You act, learn, improvise. You don't wait for perfect conditions; you shape them.

> •   Be entrepreneurial. Be a Jeep.
•   If you must follow plans, be a Ferrari. Specialized, fast, precise.
•   Don't be a Corolla. In the age of AI, that gets automated.

> Tech rewards leverage, not shortcuts. Optimize for momentum and stack useful skills, relationships, and systems. Compounding is the strongest force in your career.

> Don’t chase trends. Understand them. Ride the ones that match your strengths. Learn to take a step back, and aim for depth, clarity, and direction.
