Quoting [Patrick D. Farley](https://truegeneralist.substack.com/p/agency-the-main-character-trait):

> That brings us to: “Do humans have agency?” Classically the answer is “Of course, yes,” but if you look closely you might notice that much of the time we, too, are just doing something like “text completion.” At our jobs and even in many casual social interactions, we’re often following an implicit script—playing a well defined role the way ChatGPT does. Do you ever say “sorry” when you’re really thinking “You’re wrong”? Do you say “Sure that’s fine” when it’s not, just for the sake of social ease? Aside from text completion, think of *action completion*: do you follow through on a behavior just because it’s the *thing to do*? Keep showing up to a job you dislike? Keep living in a town that bores you?

> high agency as “Main Character Energy,” referring to the fact that the main character in a story is the person who *does interesting things* and *has unusual experiences*.

From this perspective it seems like agency is an absolutely good thing to have. I’m not sure though—there are probably times when it’s better to be able to settle in and go on autopilot for a while. Some situations are out of your control and the best course it just to get through them without freaking out. Maybe, in those situations, trying to have high agency would make you depressed when confronted by your boundedness.

> I think the modern world is always skewing us on the script-following-vs-agency spectrum. It’s just so easy to fall into a decent and well tested lifestyle script, despite all the opportunities that exist if you look for them. If you agree, then you’ll want to intentionally increase your agency, to counteract the influence of modern life.

> The easy shortcut answer to “How do I become more __?” is always: Spend more time with people who already have that trait. There’s no need to deconstruct what the trait is or where it comes from; just utilize the power of social influence to shape your character the way you want to.

As a substitute, you could read a lot of writing by people with that trait.

> you could focus on avoiding the factors that reduce your natural human agency. That’d be things like addictions and other “scripts” you follow or “ruts” you get stuck in. For example, “Every time I go out with these friends on Friday night, I drink too much and am knocked out on Saturday.” Then, you could invest a little willpower in changing that pattern, and you’d end up with more agency on your Saturdays.
