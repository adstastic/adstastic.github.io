Quoting [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/field.html):

> If something isn&#39;t important to know, there&#39;s no answer to the question of why people don&#39;t know it. Not knowing random facts is the default. But if you&#39;re going to write about things that *are* important to know, you have to ask why your readers don&#39;t already know them. Is it because they&#39;re smart but inexperienced, or because they&#39;re obtuse?

> the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell them are (a) that it&#39;s not important, (b) that they&#39;re obtuse, or (c) that they&#39;re inexperienced.

> Whatever you say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old you are. It&#39;s not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something you write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will presumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to you.

> there&#39;s a tradeoff: you can change readers&#39; thinking a lot about moderately important things, or change it a little about very important ones.

> I&#39;m not trying to surprise readers of any particular age; I&#39;m trying to surprise myself.

> Which important things do people tend to learn late?

> It&#39;s hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant topic, though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw the topic into deeper waters.
