Quoting [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/field.html):

> If something isn't important to know, there's no answer to the question of why people don't know it. Not knowing random facts is the default. But if you're going to write about things that *are* important to know, you have to ask why your readers don't already know them. Is it because they're smart but inexperienced, or because they're obtuse?

> the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell them are (a) that it's not important, (b) that they're obtuse, or (c) that they're inexperienced.

> Whatever you say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old you are. It's not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something you write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will presumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to you.

> there's a tradeoff: you can change readers' thinking a lot about moderately important things, or change it a little about very important ones.

> I'm not trying to surprise readers of any particular age; I'm trying to surprise myself.

> Which important things do people tend to learn late?

> It's hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant topic, though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw the topic into deeper waters.
