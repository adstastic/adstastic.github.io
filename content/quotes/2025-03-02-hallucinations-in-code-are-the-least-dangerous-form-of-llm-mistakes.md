Quoting [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#atom-everything):

> Proving to yourself that the code works is your job.

> A general rule for programming is that you should *never* trust any piece of code until you’ve seen it work with your own eye—or, even better, seen it fail and then fixed it.

> Across my entire career, almost every time I’ve assumed some code works without actively executing it—some branch condition that rarely gets hit, or an error message that I don’t expect to occur—I’ve later come to regret that assumption.
