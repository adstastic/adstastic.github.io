Quoting [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect):

> the Lindy effect proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, the longer its remaining life expectancy. Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#cite_note-Taleb2012-2) Where the Lindy effect applies, [mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate) *decreases* with time.
