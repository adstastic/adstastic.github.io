Quoting [bramjetten.dev](https://bramjetten.dev/articles/the-one-person-framework-in-practice?utm_source=tldrnewsletter):

> **Technical debt isn't always bad**

Sometimes the pragmatic solution that gets you to market faster is the right one, even if it's not technically perfect. Just be intentional about when you take on debt and when you pay it down.

> Fighting the framework creates unnecessary friction. The "Rails Way" exists for a reason. It allows you to focus on what makes your product unique, not reinventing solved problems.

> **Less is more**

Every gem (and JS library) adds complexity and potential points of failure. I've learned to ask "Do I really need this?" before adding anything to my Gemfile.

> **Find a community**

As a solo developer, staying connected to other Rails developers is crucial. Building Spina CMS gave me a community that didn't replace having colleagues, but provided a valuable second-best for sharing ideas and learning.

> **You can go far alone**

With Rails, a single developer can build, scale and deploy a product that would normally require an entire team of developers. Don't let conventional wisdom about "needing a team" hold you back.
