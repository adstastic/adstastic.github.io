        <p>There&rsquo;s no widely agreed-upon definition of AGI, and everything with LLMs is vibes dominated anyway, so the best we have is &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know when I see it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very rigorous, so I&rsquo;ve been thinking about concrete tasks that, when completable end-to-end, represent a serious enough step forward in outcomes, and replace a significant chunk of multi-faceted human effort that I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;feel the AGI&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a task that&rsquo;ll make me feel the AGI:</p>
<p><strong>Given the details of an applicant and visa application, determine the status of the application from the Japanese Immigration Bureau.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I, a general intelligence, did it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find various phone numbers and extensions to try from the internet/Reddit</li>
<li>Come up with a call strategy based on the experiences of people on Reddit/other advice on the internet</li>
<li>Keep trying different numbers until you get through to a human. Handle busy messages, call disconnects, endless queueing, redirects, etc.</li>
<li>Converse with that human in Japanese. If it&rsquo;s not the department that has the answer, you&rsquo;ll be told to call another number. Plead to be transferred internally rather than having to dial back and get stuck in the queue again. Handle the unsuccessful case.</li>
<li>If it is the department with the answer, handle each possible outcome state: success, pending, declined. In the terminal states, get confirmation or instructions on how to get written confirmation of the outcome.</li>
<li>If pending, get instructions on how to follow up, and information about specified edge cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>I did it all manually, of course. My Japanese is rusty so I got through mostly on vibes + asking questions, and transcribing/translating the call recording afterwards with Gemini 2.5 Pro confirmed my understanding. I had walked through the decision tree with o3 in advance, and had several keywords and prompts to guide me through, which helped a lot.</p>
<p>Of course this is a very specific task, but it&rsquo;s subtasks are applicable to many other domains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating the decision tree</li>
<li>Using tools like web search and VOIP</li>
<li>Maintaining state and following the decision tree</li>
<li>Handling real-time voice conversations</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these tasks seem possible in isolation, but composing them in a system that is robust, adaptable to high variance, stays on track, and can handle the last-mile problem is a key step towards AGI which current generation agents lack.</p>
<p>Even building an overfitted and unreliable solution to this out of the tools available today is a non-trivial task, and requires a lot of engineering effort.</p>
