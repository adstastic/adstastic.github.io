Whenever it goes down a wrong path, interrupt immediately and add a memory for the correct action, then tell it to proceed. Compact early, often, and with instructions for what to do next. If you accidentally close it, or want to resume a session, use claude -c. Run /terminal-setup for shift&#43;enter to insert newlines. Run /config and set the theme to match your terminal. Makes reading diffs much easier. Tune the allowed tools to minimise the permission prompts, but don&rsquo;t allow destructive commands or unrestricted web interaction Use it as a shell assistant - it can run any shell command, so it can perform complex workflows like &ldquo;SSH to the server, connect to the database, run a query to find something that points to a file, and download that file&rdquo; Sonnet requires more steering than Opus. Opus tends to self correct, but Sonnet &#43; more steering can move much faster for simpler tasks. Be mindful of when you&rsquo;ve passed the 50% limit and switches, and switch your style. Leverage Claude&rsquo;s understanding of git and gh to interact with it as co-worker: commit code often, push PRs, address review comments. The Github app makes this the easiest but needs API credits, so using Claude Code to read and interact with Github is a decent workaround. Put effort into your global and project Claude.md. For monorepos, write one for each directory. Iterate them often. Run them through Anthropic&rsquo;s prompt improver regularly. Setup a remote shell from your phone to where you run Claude Code. For certain tasks, it just needs a bit of steering or permission every few minutes, and you need to live your AFK life! ">
