        <p>Quoting <a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Paul Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they&rsquo;re making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they&rsquo;ll use it even when it&rsquo;s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they&rsquo;ve never heard of? If you can&rsquo;t answer that, the idea is probably bad.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future, then build what&rsquo;s missing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not &ldquo;think up&rdquo; but &ldquo;notice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t predict whether there&rsquo;s a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you&rsquo;re the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you&rsquo;re at the leading edge of a field that&rsquo;s changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you&rsquo;re more likely to be right.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I&rsquo;m telling you that the key is to have a mind that&rsquo;s prepared in the right way. But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth. And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you want to find startup ideas, don&rsquo;t merely turn on the filter &ldquo;What&rsquo;s missing?&rdquo; Also turn off every other filter, particularly &ldquo;Could this be a big company?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you&rsquo;re thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It&rsquo;s impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think &ldquo;What did I do before x?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When something annoys you, it could be because you&rsquo;re living in the future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious, at least to you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they&rsquo;d be cool. If you do that, you&rsquo;ll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn&rsquo;t seem as interesting to build something that already existed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as &ldquo;toys&rdquo; often produces good ones.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At YC we&rsquo;re excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys. To us that&rsquo;s positive evidence an idea is good.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don&rsquo;t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>things that will become startups. That&rsquo;s premature optimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students. It&rsquo;s not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank oneself into the future. You&rsquo;re also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing. If you work together with them on projects, you&rsquo;ll end up producing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that, empirically, is the best combination.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it&rsquo;s quite likely to represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you&rsquo;ll tend to feel that you&rsquo;re late. Don&rsquo;t let that deter you. Worrying that you&rsquo;re late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you&rsquo;re probably not too late. It&rsquo;s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don&rsquo;t discard the idea.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Err on the side of doing things where you&rsquo;ll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to worry about entering a &ldquo;crowded market&rdquo; so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that&rsquo;s a very promising starting point.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your thesis has to be more precise than &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to make an x that doesn&rsquo;t suck&rdquo; though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn&rsquo;t have the courage of their convictions, and that your plan is what they&rsquo;d have done if they&rsquo;d followed through on their own insights.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two more filters you&rsquo;ll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay them lots of money. They&rsquo;d prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you&rsquo;ll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a worse form of self-indulgence. Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. Even if the product doesn&rsquo;t entail a lot of schleps, you&rsquo;ll still have plenty dealing with investors, hiring and firing people, and so on. So if there&rsquo;s some idea you think would be cool but you&rsquo;re kept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don&rsquo;t worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but &ldquo;just knew&rdquo; it was promising. When you feel that about an idea you&rsquo;ve had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you&rsquo;re probably mistaken.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you&rsquo;re a database expert, don&rsquo;t build a chat app for teenagers (unless you&rsquo;re also a teenager). Maybe it&rsquo;s a good idea, but you can&rsquo;t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving databases? That&rsquo;s because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you&rsquo;re giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>try asking yourself whether there&rsquo;s something unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re probably not the only one. It&rsquo;s especially good if you&rsquo;re different in a way people will increasingly be.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you&rsquo;d previously been working on. Did you discover any needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this way.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. What&rsquo;s missing? What would they like to do that they can&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Let the conversation get general; don&rsquo;t be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You&rsquo;re just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you&rsquo;ll notice a problem they didn&rsquo;t consciously realize they had, because you know how to solve it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore. It&rsquo;s particularly good if there&rsquo;s an admixture of disdain in the big players&rsquo; attitude, because that often misleads them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer &ldquo;hobbyists&rdquo; that are currently being ignored by the big players? A startup with its sights set on bigger things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn&rsquo;t be justified by that market alone.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that&rsquo;s why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn&rsquo;t work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that&rsquo;s the real recipe.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.<br>There&rsquo;s comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them. Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas, because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the same ones.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The need has to be a strong one. You can retroactively describe any made-up idea as something you need. But do you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders &ldquo;Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn&rsquo;t written it?&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d be surprised how often the answer is no.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The best technique I&rsquo;ve found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building, they very often come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
