        <p>Quoting <a href="http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">Paul Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;work&rdquo; mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you&rsquo;ll be driving your part of it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you&rsquo;re not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You&rsquo;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of excited curiosity that&rsquo;s both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found something you&rsquo;re excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren&rsquo;t interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they&rsquo;re all overlooking, that&rsquo;s as good a bet as you&rsquo;ll find.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you&rsquo;re on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What should you do if you&rsquo;re young and ambitious but don&rsquo;t know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who&rsquo;ve done great work, it&rsquo;s remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you&rsquo;re lost.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people&rsquo;s wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you&rsquo;ll be proof against all of them. If you&rsquo;re interested, you&rsquo;re not astray.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>while you need boldness, you don&rsquo;t usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach &ldquo;staying upwind.&rdquo; This is how most people who&rsquo;ve done great work seem to have done it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren&rsquo;t like that.<br>You don&rsquo;t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there&rsquo;s a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You&rsquo;ll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don&rsquo;t worry about this; it&rsquo;s the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it&rsquo;s higher than the energy required to keep going, it&rsquo;s ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying &ldquo;How hard could it be?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one case where the young have an advantage. They&rsquo;re more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you&rsquo;re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn&rsquo;t quite right. When you&rsquo;re procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You&rsquo;re not just sitting around doing nothing; you&rsquo;re working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn&rsquo;t set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You&rsquo;re too busy to notice it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can&rsquo;t think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it&rsquo;s happening.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you&rsquo;re genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you&rsquo;re surprised how far you&rsquo;ve come.<br>The reason we&rsquo;re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but if you do it every day you&rsquo;ll write a book a year. That&rsquo;s the key: consistency. People who do great things don&rsquo;t get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do work that compounds, you&rsquo;ll get exponential growth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can&rsquo;t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it&rsquo;s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Work doesn&rsquo;t just happen when you&rsquo;re trying to. There&rsquo;s a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you&rsquo;ll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.<br>You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can&rsquo;t just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions. [10]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it&rsquo;s also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you&rsquo;ll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don&rsquo;t avoid love.)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re aiming for.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t try to be the best, you won&rsquo;t even be good.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can; you won&rsquo;t be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.<br>Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries&rsquo;, but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you succeed at an ambitious project, you&rsquo;re not a nobody; you&rsquo;re the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We&rsquo;re taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it&rsquo;s a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You&rsquo;re trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you&rsquo;re intellectually dishonest?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you&rsquo;re mistaken. Once you&rsquo;ve admitted you were mistaken about something, you&rsquo;re free. Till then you have to carry it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you&rsquo;re trying to seem a certain way as you&rsquo;re doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That&rsquo;s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that&rsquo;s basically the definition of a nerd.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that&rsquo;s exactly what you need in doing great work. It&rsquo;s not learned; it&rsquo;s preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to criticize&rdquo; is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you want to do great work it&rsquo;s an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you&rsquo;ll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There&rsquo;s an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it&rsquo;s better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that&rsquo;s advice for seeming smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it&rsquo;s better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It&rsquo;s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won&rsquo;t necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there&rsquo;s something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I&rsquo;d already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to strip whatever you&rsquo;re doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you&rsquo;ll understand it better; and you won&rsquo;t be able to lie to yourself about whether there&rsquo;s anything real there.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they&rsquo;re hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good sign when it&rsquo;s hard to say whether you&rsquo;re creating something or discovering it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn&rsquo;t expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don&rsquo;t know what the benefit will be.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it&rsquo;s a good sign if you&rsquo;re creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas.</p></blockquote>
