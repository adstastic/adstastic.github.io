        <p>Quoting <a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls">Dario Amodei</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are naturally attracted to the idea that &ldquo;first something is expensive, then it gets cheaper&rdquo; — as if AI is a single thing of constant quality, and when it gets cheaper, we&rsquo;ll use fewer chips to train it. But what&rsquo;s important is the scaling curve: when it shifts, we simply traverse it faster, because the value of what&rsquo;s at the end of the curve is so high.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>because this type of RL is new, we are still very early on the scaling curve: the amount being spent on the second, RL stage is small for all players. Spending $1M instead of $0.1M is enough to get huge gains. Companies are now working very quickly to scale up the second stage to hundreds of millions and billions, but it&rsquo;s crucial to understand that we&rsquo;re at a unique &ldquo;crossover point&rdquo; where there is a powerful new paradigm that is early on the scaling curve and therefore can make big gains quickly.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DeepSeek-V3 is not a unique breakthrough or something that fundamentally changes the economics of LLM’s; it’s an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve. What’s different this time is that the company that was first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions was Chinese.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the historical trend of the cost curve decrease is ~4x per year, that means that in the ordinary course of business — in the normal trends of historical cost decreases like those that happened in 2023 and 2024 — we’d expect a model 3-4x cheaper than 3.5 Sonnet/GPT-4o around now. Since DeepSeek-V3 is worse than those US frontier models — let’s say by ~2x on the scaling curve, which I think is quite generous to DeepSeek-V3 — that means it would be totally normal, totally &ldquo;on trend&rdquo;, if DeepSeek-V3 training cost ~8x less than the current US models developed a year ago.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the economic value of training more and more intelligent models is so great that any cost gains are more than eaten up almost immediately — they&rsquo;re poured back into making even smarter models for the same huge cost we were originally planning to spend.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that US labs haven&rsquo;t already discovered them, the efficiency innovations DeepSeek developed will soon be applied by both US and Chinese labs to train multi-billion dollar models. These will perform better than the multi-billion models they were previously planning to train — but they&rsquo;ll still spend multi-billions. That number will continue going up, until we reach AI that is smarter than almost all humans at almost all things.</p></blockquote>
