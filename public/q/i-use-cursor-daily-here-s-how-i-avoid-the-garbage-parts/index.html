It&rsquo;s always gonna come back to bite you. • Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it manually. You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better. • Ask &quot;is this the best way to do this?&quot; or &quot;have you considered xyz&quot;. • Learn when a problem is best solved manually. • Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it&rsquo;s particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process. • If it&rsquo;s a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.

<p>The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say &quot;please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing.&quot;</p></blockquote>
