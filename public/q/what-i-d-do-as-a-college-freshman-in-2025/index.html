    <meta name="description" content="Quoting Blogger:
Being supported by AI tools is not a substitute for mastery. You can’t borrow skills. You have to earn them.
We&rsquo;re heading into the age of π-shaped people: depth in two areas, and generalist across. Building depth first, and then ranging is good strategy.
Clear communication matters more than ever:
• for working with others (especially remotely) • for building in the open • for working with LLMs.
Management skills matters too. Not just for leading teams, but also for leading yourself. Self-help book gets mocked, but they are useful for the querying/investigating they ignite in you, rather than their vacuous/repetitive advice. Know yourself. Then fool yourself into greatness.

<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need a title to lead teams. Influence scales from the bottom. You have more leverage and autonomy than you realize, especially early in your career.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Credentialism is fading, but community isn&rsquo;t. College is still the best place to meet smart people, get inspired, and build with peers. Don&rsquo;t waste it competing and just following lectures. Learn from each other. Take initiative. Start things.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Effectual thinking is messy yet powerful. It starts with what you have. You act, learn, improvise. You don&rsquo;t wait for perfect conditions; you shape them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>•   Be entrepreneurial. Be a Jeep.
•   If you must follow plans, be a Ferrari. Specialized, fast, precise.
•   Don&rsquo;t be a Corolla. In the age of AI, that gets automated.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech rewards leverage, not shortcuts. Optimize for momentum and stack useful skills, relationships, and systems. Compounding is the strongest force in your career.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t chase trends. Understand them. Ride the ones that match your strengths. Learn to take a step back, and aim for depth, clarity, and direction.</p></blockquote>
