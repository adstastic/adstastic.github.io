    <title>Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences) | ~/Adi</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Quoting Eliezer Yudkowsky:
The rationalist virtue of empiricism consists of constantly asking which experiences our beliefs predict—or better yet, prohibit.
The two beliefs are connected to each other, though still not connected to any anticipated experience.
We can build up whole networks of beliefs that are connected only to each other—call these “floating” beliefs.
Then what does this belief not allow to happen—what would definitely falsify this belief? A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience; it permits anything to happen to you. It floats.

<blockquote>
<p>don’t ask what to believe—ask what to anticipate. Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry. Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation, and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief turns deadbeat, evict it.</p></blockquote>
