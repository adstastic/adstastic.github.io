understand words as hidden inferences – they refer to a multidimensional correlation rather than to a single cohesive property.
Happiness must be the same way. It’s an amalgam between a bunch of correlated properties like your subjective well-being at any given moment, and the amount of positive emotions you feel, and how meaningful your life is, et cetera. And each of those correlated is also an amalgam, and so on to infinity.

And <em>each of those correlated is also an amalgam</em>, and so on to infinity.</p></blockquote>
<p>And crucially, it’s not an amalgam in the sense of “add subjective well-being, amount of positive emotions, and meaningfulness and divide by three”. It’s an unprincipled conflation of these that just denies they’re different at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think there’s another interpretation. It’s not just that “quality of life”, “positive emotions”, and “meaningfulness” are three contributors which each give 33% of the activation to our central node of “happiness”. It’s that we got some training data – the prisoner is unhappy, the millionaire is happy – and used it to build a classifier that told us what happiness was. The training data was ambiguous enough that different people built different classifiers. Maybe one person built a classifier that was based entirely on quality-of-life, and a second person built a classifier based entirely around positive emotions. Then we loaded that with all the social valence of the word “happiness”, which we <a href="https://samzdat.com/2018/08/03/slightly-less-than-truths-iv-v/">naively expected to transfer across paradigms</a>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the most merciful thing in the world is how so far we have managed to stay in the area where the human mind <em>can</em> correlate its contents.</p></blockquote>
