<blockquote>
<p>Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you. Most famous people go <em>off-script</em> early, usually in more than one way.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We seem to have a political (public) imagination so shallow that it cannot conceive of what to even <em>do</em> with children, especially smart children. We fail to properly respect them all the way through adolescence, so we have engineered them to be useless in the interim. We do not <em>need</em> children to work, that is abundantly clear, but by ensuring there is <em>nothing</em> for them to do we are also sure to destroy more onramps towards making meaningful contributions to the world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the fault for this lies in an attempt at systematizing skill and knowledge transfer so thoroughly that people begin to conceive of it as the task of school, rather than a normal consequence of work.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thinking that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence? By confining <em>meaningful</em> work to an adult-only activity, it is little wonder that adolescence is a period of great depression. It would be surprising if it was not. Even for smart children, education endlessly ushers them towards an often far and always abstract future, so far and abstract that some children seem to apprise the opposite of agency, they take on a learned helplessness, and downplay that the future is a reality at all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that the more you ask of people, and the more you have them <em>do,</em> the more they are able to later do on their own.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>some people exit academia almost terrified to leave (to interact with the “real world”), a kind of Stockholm syndrome. How could we celebrate a higher learning that creates something so pathetic, the opposite of a readiness for life?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.</p></blockquote>
