    <meta name="description" content="Quoting Paul Graham:
What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They&rsquo;d be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That&rsquo;s not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can&rsquo;t simply plow through them, because you don&rsquo;t know initially how hard they are; you don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.
