<p>and insufficient smarts can be surprisingly double-edged—an RNG run would arguably be better at both leveling and navigating mazes through sheer random walkitude and willingness to bash face into every fight</p>
<p>as opposed to getting stuck in loops or refusing to engage for bad reasons</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my ted talk but my overall thesis is still Executive Function is an unsolved problem</p>
<p>(Executive Function is, reminder, goals, prioritization, attention, etc.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This current Claudeplayspokemon run is actually an interesting encapsulation of current limitations in llms</p></blockquote>
<p>That are more fundamental than just &quot;LLMs don&rsquo;t understand spatial reasoning&quot; (but they don&rsquo;t)</p>
<p>They added a whole new memory system after Run #2 with short term and long-term text files and the ability to edit and store and archive and now he has a pretty good memory system that does improve navigation</p>
<p>but now the lack of executive planning and goal-planning and grasp of reality is really rearing its head</p>
<p>no amount of good memory system will save you if you just randomly see something and go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh I&rsquo;ve achieved my goal!&quot;<br>
&quot;Time to delete all my past files about achieving this goal!&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>when goal was not actually achieved<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HyD3khBjnBhvsp8Gb/so-how-well-is-claude-playing-pokemon#fn1efat5c1td1h">[5]</a></p>
<p>It really lacks a lot of human ability to plan, hold multiple goals at once, prioritize, and just keep a grasp of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(re: goal orientation, you just have to witness its relative inability to simultaneously aim for the short-term goal while also leveling up its pokemon)</p></blockquote>
<p>(It can level its pokemon if that&rsquo;s the goal right now, or move forward if that its goal right now, but it can&rsquo;t simultaneously level up pokemon while also moving forward)</p>
<p>(at least not to a human level of efficiency, it will half-heartedly do some combat while the team is healthy then immediately abandon any thought of leveling if the team is moderately injured)</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s also not capable of changing goals on the fly and going &quot;Well I&rsquo;m too injured to make it, let&rsquo;s get some levels and bail&quot;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Executive Function (agents, etc.) has always been the big missing puzzle piece, and even with copious amounts of test-time compute, tool use, scaffolding, external memory, the latest and greatest LLM still is not at even a child&rsquo;s level.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the thing about ClaudePlaysPokémon is that it feels so close sometimes. Each &quot;action&quot; is reasoned carefully (if often on the basis of faulty knowledge), and of course Claude&rsquo;s irrepressible good humor is charming. If it could just plan a little better, or had a little outside direction, it&rsquo;d clearly blow through the game no problem.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s fairly obvious if there was just someone human there to monitor Claude and give it some guidance maybe once every hour, it&rsquo;d probably be 10x further through the game now</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s meaningful insomuch as from a &quot;taking people&rsquo;s jobs&quot; point of view it may be possible to, even if the AI really sucks at goal planning, just chain 10 bad AIs to one employee and have them monitor</p>
<p>this still sucks ~9 jobs away from people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Executive Function&quot; and the brain regions associated with it are the largest and most recently evolved in humans</p></blockquote>
<p>which makes sense</p>
<p>but a lot of goal-orientation and grasp on reality stuff is reasonably well-developed in the average squirrel</p>
<p>Not to a human level but better than most LLMs</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a matter of &quot;this is hard stuff that only elite humans do&quot;</p>
<p>No, a decent amount of this is fairly old stuff that&rsquo;s probably pretty deep in the brain, and the evolutionary pressure is presumably fairly strong to have developed it fast</p>
<p>but the financial pressure on LLMs doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the same effect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ClaudePlaysPokémon is proof that the last 6 months of AI innovation, while incredible, are still far from the true unhobbling necessary for an AI revolution. That doesn&rsquo;t mean 2-year AGI timelines are <em>wrong</em>, but it does feel to me like some new paradigm is yet required for them to be <em>right</em>. If you watch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon">the stream</a> for a couple hours, I think you&rsquo;ll feel the same.</p></blockquote>
