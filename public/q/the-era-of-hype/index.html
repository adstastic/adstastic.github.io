<blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen too many small fund managers praising their higher likelihood of success</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The real problem isn’t just the quantity but the shift in mindset: investors increasingly approach venture capital like a numbers game, prioritizing portfolio diversification and quick deployment over deep conviction. This creates a bias toward ideas that are scalable and trendy rather than bold and risky.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting a company, for many, is no longer an act of rebellion or mission-driven obsession; it’s a résumé item, a stepping stone to prestige.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, failure is often seen as just another step in a polished LinkedIn narrative. Seed funding has become a safety net, allowing entrepreneurs to test ideas without putting their skin fully in the game. Venture capital has essentially subsidized the idea that starting a company is as much a career choice as going to business school or joining a management consulting firm.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when the underlying motivations shift from “building the next big thing” to “playing the game,” the results are predictably mediocre.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Winners are not just reactive participants in the ecosystem; they are the architects of it, ensuring they continue to command the largest share of returns.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Funds outside the top 1%—whose returns don’t outperform safer, more liquid asset classes—likely shouldn’t exist for sophisticated investors. Anything with a (realistic) target return lower than ~5x over 10 years cannot justify the “illiquidity price”.</p></blockquote>
