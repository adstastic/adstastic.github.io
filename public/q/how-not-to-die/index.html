The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with &quot;but we&rsquo;re going to keep working on the startup,&quot; you are in big trouble. Bob&rsquo;s going to grad school, but we&rsquo;re going to keep working on the startup. We&rsquo;re moving back to Minnesota, but we&rsquo;re going to keep working on the startup. We&rsquo;re taking on some consulting projects, but we&rsquo;re going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to &quot;we&rsquo;re giving up on the startup, but we&rsquo;re not willing to admit that to ourselves,&quot; because that&rsquo;s what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it can&rsquo;t be preceded by &quot;but.&quot;
