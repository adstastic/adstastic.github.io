        <p>Quoting <a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-be-more-agentic">Cate Hall</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually <em>choosing</em> &ndash; often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you aren’t trying to get real feedback from people who know you, you’re cooking without tasting. This is, like, the lowest hanging fruit for self-improvement, but few people really try to pick it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The last couple times I was looking for a project, I made a point of meeting as many people doing related work as I could, even if there was no obvious benefit to doing so. At first, I did this just to advertise my existence to people as I entered a new field, because someone is always hiring or looking for a cofounder.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance. Relevance is easier to predict, but it’s not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person’s enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests. To some extent, the more confident I am that a conversation is relevant, the less likely I am to discover something exciting during it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assume everything is learnable</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s called a moat both because you can’t just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage. It’s possible to cross the moat quietly, by not asking questions and not collaborating, but those tradeoffs really nerf learning. “Learn by doing” is standard advice, but you can’t do that unless you splash around in the moat for a bit.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my instinct is to think more hours mean more productivity as long as you’re really <em>trying</em> to be productive &ndash; that’s just multiplication, right? No. The reality is that grinding, even if it temporarily increases output, kills creativity and big picture thinking.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer. This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening. A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won’t work or aren’t necessary, rather than chasing better versions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never to take instructions on how hard I should work from someone who hasn’t burned out before. Very few people take this seriously enough.</p></blockquote>
