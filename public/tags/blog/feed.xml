      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was stranded in Madrid after having my passport stolen in Barcelona, I wrote a Magnum Opus of my experiences so that anyone going through the same harrowing situation would have a clear and empathetic guide to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On returning to London, I decided to reinstall MacOS on my laptop and set it up securely, following &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide&#34;&gt;this excellent guide&lt;/a&gt;.
