      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy good coffee, and over time have accumulated tools and techniques to improve my home brew. I rarely pay for someone to make me coffee anymore, and when I do it&amp;rsquo;s for research purposes. If you&amp;rsquo;re not a coffee connoisseur, all of this may seem ridiculous to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee, like many things, seems very simple from the outside if you&amp;rsquo;re haven&amp;rsquo;t started exploring it&amp;rsquo;s depths. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve only ever had instant coffee, or it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than tiredness-be-gone beverage for you - that&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with this. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly this way with many things, I think most of us are - because time and attention are finite resources. This is an account of my coffee journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
