> There&#39;s a new kind of coding I call &#34;hype coding&#34; where you fully give into the hype, and what&#39;s coming right around the corner, that you lose sight of whats&#39; possible today. Everything is changing so fast that nobody has time to learn any tool, but we should aim to use as many as possible. Any limitation in the technology can be chalked up to a &#39;skill issue&#39; or that it&#39;ll be solved in the next AI release next week. Thinking is dead. Turn off your brain and let the computer think for you. Scroll on tiktok while the armies of agents code for you. If it isn&#39;t right, tell it to try again. Don&#39;t read. Feed outputs back in until it works. If you can&#39;t get it to work, wait for the next model or tool release. Maybe you didn&#39;t use enough MCP servers? Don&#39;t forget to add to the hype cycle by aggrandizing all your successes. Don&#39;t read this whole tweet, because it&#39;s too long. Get an AI to summarize it for you. Then call it &#34;cope&#34;. Most importantly, immediately mischaracterize &#34;hype coding&#34; to mean something different than this definition. Oh the irony! The people who don&#39;t care about details don&#39;t read the details about not reading the details
