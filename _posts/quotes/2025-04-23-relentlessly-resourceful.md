Quoting [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html):

> What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They&#39;d be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That&#39;s not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can&#39;t simply plow through them, because you don&#39;t know initially how hard they are; you don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.
