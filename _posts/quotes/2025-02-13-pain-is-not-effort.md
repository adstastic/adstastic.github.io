Quoting [alkjash](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bx3gkHJehRCYZAF3r/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort):

> To this day there&#39;s a gremlin on my shoulder that whispers, &#34;If you&#39;re happy, you&#39;re not trying your best.&#34;

> I have a close friend who often asks for my perspective on personal problems. A pattern arose in a couple of our conversations:
> 
> alkjash: I feel like you&#39;re not actually trying. [Meaning: using all the tools at your disposal, getting creative, throwing money at the problem to make it go away.]
> 
> alkjash&#39;s friend: What do you mean I&#39;m not trying? I think I&#39;m trying my best, can&#39;t you tell how hard I&#39;m trying? [Meaning: piling on time, energy, and willpower to the point of burnout.]

> After several of these conversations went nowhere, I learned that asking this friend to try harder directly translated in his mind to accusing him of low pain tolerance and asking him to hurt himself more.

> I think I finally understand why so few people are &#34;actually trying.&#34; The reason is this pervasive and damaging belief that *pain is the unit of effort.* With this belief, the injunction &#34;actually try&#34; means &#34;put yourself in as much pain as you can handle.&#34; Similarly, &#34;she&#39;s trying her best&#34; translates to &#34;she&#39;s really hurting right now.&#34; Even worse, people with this belief *optimize for the appearance of suffering*. Answering emails at midnight and appearing fatigued at meetings are somehow taken to be more credible signals of effort than actual results. And if you think that&#39;s pathological, wait until you meet someone for whom *telling them about opportunities actively hurts them*, because you&#39;ve just created another knife they feel pressured to cut themselves with.

> Such rules are well-established in the setting of physical exercise, but their analogs in intellectual work seem to be completely lost on people. If reading a math paper is actively unpleasant, you should find a better-written paper or learn some background material first (most likely both). If you study or work late into the night and it disrupts your Circadian rhythm, you&#39;re trading off long-term productivity and well-being for low-quality work. That&#39;s just bad form.

> If it hurts, you&#39;re probably doing it wrong.

> Happiness is really, really instrumentally useful. Being happy gives you more energy, increases your physical health and lifespan, makes you more creative and risk-tolerant, and (even if all the previous effects are unreplicated pseudoscience) causes other people to like you more. Whether you are tackling the Riemann hypothesis, climate change, or your personal weight loss, one of the first steps should be to acquire as much happiness as you can get your hands on.

> Culturally, we&#39;ve been led to believe that over-stressed and tired people are the ones trying their best. It is right and proper to be kind to such people, but let&#39;s not go so far as to support the delusion that they are inputting as much effort as their joyful, boisterous peers bouncing off the walls.

> You&#39;re not trying your best if you&#39;re not happy.

> *The more bitterness you swallow, the higher you&#39;ll go.* ~ Chinese proverb.
