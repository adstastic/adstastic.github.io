Quoting [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/hyn):

> If you’re not feeling “Hell yeah, that would be awesome!” about something, say no.
> 
> It’s an easier decision. **Say no to almost everything.** This starts to free your time and mind.
> 
> Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have the space in your life to give it your full attention. You’ll be able to take massive action, in a way that most people can’t, because you cleared away your clutter in advance. **Saying no makes your yes more powerful.**
