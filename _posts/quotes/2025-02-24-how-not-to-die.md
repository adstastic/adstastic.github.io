Quoting [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/die.html):

> The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with &#34;but we&#39;re going to keep working on the startup,&#34; you are in big trouble. Bob&#39;s going to grad school, but we&#39;re going to keep working on the startup. We&#39;re moving back to Minnesota, but we&#39;re going to keep working on the startup. We&#39;re taking on some consulting projects, but we&#39;re going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to &#34;we&#39;re giving up on the startup, but we&#39;re not willing to admit that to ourselves,&#34; because that&#39;s what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it can&#39;t be preceded by &#34;but.&#34;
