Quoting [Jj, May 22](https://deplet.ing/the-copilot-delusion/):

> &#34;Hold up. I’ve got an idea. Gimme the keyboard real quick.&#34;

An idea. Yes. The same way a toddler has &#34;*an idea*&#34; to stick a fork in a wall socket. I was halfway through constructing something beautiful; a lean, elegant piece of logic that sliced through complexity like a blade through butter-and here he comes, pounding the keyboard like it owes him money, pasting in code he *Frankensteined* from a stack overflow comment written by an Uncle Bob disciple in 2014.

> And I got lazy. Of course I did. When the system forces you to code with a hallucinating clown, eventually you stop resisting. You let him type. You let him be &#34;productive.&#34; You check out. You surrender your brain to the noise and just float.

> Copilot is like a thoughtless yet high-functioning, practically poor intern:

•   Great with syntax memory.
•   Surprisingly quick at listing out your blind spots.
•   Good at building scaffolding if you feed it the exact right words.
•   Horrible at nuance.
•   Useless without supervision.
•   Will absolutely kill you in production if left alone for 30 seconds.

> When you outsource the thinking, you outsource the learning. You become a conduit for a mechanical bird regurgitating it&#39;s hunt directly into your baby-bird mouth. You don’t *know* your code. You’re babysitting it.

> You build taste by *doing*. By hurting. By shaving nanoseconds with surgical tools. By writing a routine on Monday, rewriting it Tuesday, and realizing Wednesday it still sucks. You don’t build taste by asking the MS Clippy of 2025 how to do your job.
