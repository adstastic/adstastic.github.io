Quoting [Benn Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqtrNXdlraM):

> The point of all this maneuvering is decreasingly about turning a profit and increasingly about transitioning to a rent-based economy that hedges inflation

> profit and even money itself are only really valuable when they buy power. And if a societal system can be engineered to gain power without profit or money, capitalism begins to exist as something to exploit within that system, under its umbrella

> Most of us do not realize that we are in a constant battle with billionaires who don&#39;t want us to own things but rent them. And when we don&#39;t own things, we lose control over our own budgets, lives, decisions, and

ultimately our own destinies.

> It would be very naive to think of digital assistance as your assistance; they are very much not there to help you, but to help their owners. The conclusion that most of us have is that they’re there to help their owners make more money. But in the case of things like the Cambridge Analytica scandal or Twitter, quite literally and intentionally becoming an interactive right-wing There’s a lot more to be worried about than money. What we ultimately have is money being extracted to systems that do not grow or scale the way a capitalist system does, by expanding the assembly line, opening more chain restaurants, or researching and patenting a new type of refrigerant.

> In World War II, as we strained every single resource that we had, it skyrocketed to 121%, meaning that we had 21% more debt than value as a nation. Our debt to GDP ratio once again skyrocketed after the 2008 crisis, and it just kept rising. Right now, we are at 123%, higher than it has ever been in the history of our economy. Our national debt as of February 2025 is $36.5 trillion, and our total debt is $102 trillion. I would say that we&#39;re well past the point of no return, but I don&#39;t even know what that is, because this is so unprecedented.

And I assume that it would be easier to Change the value and concept of money than it would be to repay that level of debt. It&#39;s worth pointing out that the primary owner of that debt isn’t China, or Japan, or even our own Federal Reserve; it’s us, investors. As this cycle continues to snowball, money will be less and less valuable, not only because of inflation, but in principle, when the government is so closely entangled with the people who have benefited the most from this mass extraction of wealth from a capitalist economy, it stops making

sense to think of wealth as money.
