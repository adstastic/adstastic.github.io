Quoting [Valentine](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwdcMts8P8hacqwrX/noticing-the-taste-of-lotus):

> my disagreement comes from knowing what I’m talking about when it comes to my learning, and someone’s arbitrary gold stars immediately overrode all that insight by grabbing my motivations directly.

> I don’t have a problem with gamification per se. What bugs me here is that this specific gamification didn’t fit my goals, and that fact didn’t at all affect how well the system grabbed my wanting. I just… wanted those achievements. Because they were there.

> Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”. He’s referring to [a part of the Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters) where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.

> Also notice when someone else built the want-grabber. Their incentives are probably different from yours. If you don’t pay attention, you’ll get hijacked.

> And then you’re prone to rationalizing your addiction — like thinking that Facebook keeps you connected to your friends, but not really caring that [maybe that’s false](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002209).

> I find this gets easier if you give yourself permission to eat lotuses if you want to. Then I don’t have to lie to myself about whether I am or not. I can just play Alto’s Adventure, or clear out my email, or whatever, and it’s fine. I just pay attention to the actual consequences — including the impact on what I later find myself *wanting to do*.

> It feels satisfying and empowering to resist the impulse to go back there and get one more star.
