> Which parts of your identity do you loudly proclaim that you&#39;re actually secretly very unsure about?

> What trait that people strongly associate with you is almost pure performance on your part and totally fails to reflect your inner life?

> Look around your environment. Now look again, but this time notice the thing you tried not to see the first time because it was making you anxious and avoidant. What is that thing and why is it scary?

> Who do you want to trust more than you do and what is stopping you?
