> **Garbage Truck**

- David Pierce shares that the best AI experience he had was with an app that records his son yelling &#34;garbage truck&#34;. 
- He would pay for the app only if it provides the recording of his son yelling at garbage trucks.

David Pierce
Right, I just want to leave you with the best thing that has happened to me, and then we&#39;re going to get out of here. So this morning, my two-year son has been up since three o&#39;clock this morning, so I just left the pendant on all morning. We were hanging out, and here is just a chunk of our day, as described by the Limitless app. Going to the playground and observing a garbage truck. Suggesting a trip to the playground. Pointing out a garbage truck. Expressing awe. Identifying a garbage truck again. Discussing going to the playground. Identifying a garbage truck. Which, A, unbelievably good description of my morning. And it&#39;s like, there&#39;s a little bit of that that I really enjoyed. And it can play some of the audio of him pointing at a garbage truck and yelling garbage truck. And that&#39;s nice. But just give me that. Forget all the rest of this stuff. Just give me my son saying garbage truck over and over and I will pay for this thing. And I&#39;ll be happy about it. It&#39;s the best experience I&#39;ve had with any AI product ever. It&#39;s just the thing that shows me the recording of my son yelling at garbage trucks.

> **Overheard in the Office**

- AI recorders can capture and memorialize conversations, revealing details you wouldn&#39;t normally know. 
- This feels intrusive and makes you feel like a spy, especially when you overhear sensitive information.

The conversations that I heard in the that I heard, not me, but this pen heard and then memorialized in the office. And decided we&#39;re yours. And we&#39;re decided like I&#39;m hearing snippets of conversations of our colleagues talking about videos on other verticals that I have no business knowing but have been recorded. It really just kind of, it made me feel paranoid in some ways of just like, you never know who&#39;s listening. And to a degree, we know that because in the early days of the internet, I don&#39;t know if you knew the site, but it was called Overheard in New York. And it&#39;s just like little conversations that people overhear and upload online. And that&#39;s fine in a way because it&#39;s anonymous. You&#39;re not describing who these people are. But it captures names. It captures projects. It, like, captured that two people somewhere in the Vox Media office were talking about big cat sanctuaries on a day in February and that I had no business knowing this, but I overheard It and they don&#39;t know it. I know it. And you just sit there with that knowledge and how, like, immense it feels and how icky you feel having perpetrated it on someone that no amount of disclosure can really fully make you Feel right again having done it you feel like a spy like it&#39;s a weird transition to these ai wearables like the smart glasses that can record the ai recorders that listen to everything
