title: Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)
---

Quoting [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences):

> The rationalist virtue of empiricism consists of constantly asking which experiences our beliefs predict—or better yet, prohibit.

> The two beliefs are connected to each other, though still not connected to any anticipated experience.<br>We can build up whole networks of beliefs that are connected only to each other—call these “floating” beliefs.

> Then what does this belief not allow to happen—what would definitely falsify this belief? A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience; it permits anything to happen to you. It floats.

> don’t ask what to believe—ask what to anticipate. Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry. Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation, and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief turns deadbeat, evict it.
