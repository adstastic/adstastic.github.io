> Even if I have a lot on my plate, being happier will help me do it. It&#39;s like sleep: it&#39;s easy to keep staying up and staying up, because sleep just seems so *unproductive*, and you can get *some* work done however tired you are. But over the long term, getting to sleep at a sane hour every day will let you accomplish more; and so with maintaining a good affect consistently. Mood maintenance is typically not the most *immediately productive* thing I could be doing, but treating it as my top priority save in dire emergency has let me be more effective than I was before.
