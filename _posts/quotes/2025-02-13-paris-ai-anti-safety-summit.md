Quoting [Zvi Mowshowitz](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-paris-ai-anti-safety-summit):

> Imagine if the 2015 Paris Climate Summit was renamed the &#34;Energy Action Summit,&#34; invited leaders from across the fossil fuel industry, raised millions for fossil fuels, ignored IPCC reports, and produced an agreement that didn&#39;t even mention climate change. #AIActionSummit

> Rhetorically, if you even mention the fact that this plan probably gets everyone killed, they respond that they cannot worry about that, they cannot lift a single finger to (for example) ask to be informed by major labs of their frontier model training runs, because if they do that then we will Lose to China. Everyone goes full jingoist and wraps themselves in the flag and ‘freedom,’ full ‘innovation’ and so on.

> Meanwhile, from what I hear, the Europeans think that Because DeepSeek they can compete with America too, so they’re going to go full speed on the zero-safeguards plan. Without any thought, of course, to how highly capable open AIs could be compatible with the European form of government, let alone human survival.
