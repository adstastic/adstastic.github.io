Quoting [AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk):

> Every chart and benchmark, it seems, is going up and to the right. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it seems like these kind of small hallucinations are the last thin line of defense for so much of white collar work. On one prompt, I got deep research to analyze 39 separate references in the Deep Seek R1 paper, and though it hallucinated a little bit, the results were extraordinary in their depth.

> Making these kinds of repeated hallucinations, wouldn&#39;t this news be effectively a redundancy notice for tens of millions of people? I&#39;m not going to lie; one day, that redundancy notice may come to me, because I was casually browsing YouTube the other day, and I saw this YouTube channel that was clearly AI-generated. The voice was obviously AI-generated. I know many people accuse me of being an AI, but I&#39;m not. But this voice, trust me, it was, and yet none of the comments were referencing it. The analysis was pretty decent, and the video editing was pretty smooth. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a human in the loop somewhere, but come next year or the year after, or possibly the end of

> this year, there will be videos analyzing the news in AI instantly, the moment it happens, with in-depth massive analysis far quicker than I can ever do. Obviously, I hope you guys stick around, but man, things are progressing fast, and sometimes I&#39;m just like, this is a lot to process. For now, though, at least yes, it does struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors, although it does a better job than DeepSeek R1 with search, Much better than deep research from Gemini, not quite as good, I think, as me for now, but the clock is ticking.
