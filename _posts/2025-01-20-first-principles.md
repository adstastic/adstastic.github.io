I've been reading a few round-ups of life advice/principles in toward the end of 2024. There's usually a lot of good but generic advice there, so I wanted to write something for myself to follow in 2025. I intend this to be a living document I update over time, and reference daily to keep myself aimed in the right direction.

#### Action precedes motivation.

#### You will run out of time and health sooner than you think.
#### You can't hoard life.
Experiences are ephemeral. Your memory of them is mostly fiction. Don't chase, don't cling.

#### You are not a child.
Do not play games, especially with yourself. 
#### Accept suffering.
Life involves a lot of neccessary suffering. Don't be averse to it. Hardship builds character and connects us all.

#### If you don’t try to be the best, you won’t even be good.

#### Consistency over intensity
Exponentials feel flat in the beginning. Herculean feats are achieved by consistently doing compounding work. 
#### Avoid affectation.

#### Do not fool yourself.
Be earnest and intellectually honest.
#### No one is going to save you.
You won’t magically wake up one day and have solutions or the motivation to pursue them. Apply effort, starting now.
#### You are what you dare.
