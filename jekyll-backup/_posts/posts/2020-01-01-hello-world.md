The end of the year is a good time for reflection. 

I found myself with a lot of time and not much to do at the end of 2019 as my travel documents were stolen and I was waiting for replacements[^travel-documents-stolen], so I started writing. 

I've always thought I should create more, especially since I end up consuming so much content. It'll probably help me remember the important things, as well as become a better writer. It may even be helpful, or at least entertaining, to someone else. 

I was influenced by a bunch of blog posts, most recently ["Why you should write"](https://www.perell.com/blog/why-you-should-write) by David Perell[^david-perell-discovery], which convinced me to get started. 

So, after the obligatory day spent researching blogging platforms, evaluating many _many_ themes, trying several hosting options (before realising that it doesn't really matter), and seriously considering writing a static site generator myself, here we go.

Hopefully I can build this into a habit that continues after life gets busy again!


Footnotes:


[^travel-documents-stolen]: It's been a challenging experience, and I gained solace from a few blog posts by people who went through it before me. To pay that forward, I'm writing up my own experience and will be posting on here soon.

[^david-perell-discovery]: I came across David Perell's blog when his ["Coolest things I learned in 2019"](https://www.perell.com/blog/2019/12/11/coolest-things-i-learned-in-2019) made the Hacker News top 10. It's a great read.
