These times are tough for all. Even if you're fit and healthy, there are many small problems to which solutions would normally be readily available which become large problems because of the lockdown.

I came across such a case today. Someone in my mutual aid group posted about acute toothache and wasn't able to get help anywhere - the authorities, local clinics, hospitals all turning them away because their condition was not life threatening (e.g. uncontrolled bleeding).

I described the situation to a friend of mine who is a dentist, who said to pass on their number. 

A few hours I get a text from the OP in the mutual aid group that they're walking back from my friend's clinic, having just had their tooth extracted. It turned out to be quite a serious case, and the intervention came at the right time. 

My friend is the real hero here, using their dental superpowers for good, but this whole situation made me realise the value of being a relay. My role was very minor, but crucial - I connected someone in need of a service to someone who could offer that service. 

Few people have the professional skills to help on the frontlines of this pandemic.  but even if those opportunities don't present themselves, you can still help by connecting people to useful information - by being an information relay.
