title: You can't hoard life
---

Quoting [ckarchive.com](https://ckarchive.com/b/68ueh8hkxrx6lukq88gqmtz7vxkkk):

> “we cannot get anything out of life. There is no outside where we could take this thing to. There is no little pocket situated outside of life”

> Spending your days trying to get experiences “under your belt”, in an effort to maximise your collection of experiences, or to feel more confident about the future supply of similar experiences, means placing yourself in a position from which you can never enjoy them fully, because there’s a different agenda at play.

> experiences are for having, not for hoarding.
