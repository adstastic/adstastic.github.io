Quoting [Utsav Mamoria](https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich?r=5lwff8&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true):

> Epistemic Anxiety is the feeling of uneasiness, tension, and concern when you want to know the truth. You worry that your knowledge is incomplete and full of errors, and you may believe it.

You either lack the resources, methods or agency to get to the truth.

> When we surround ourselves with abundant, diverse ideas, complex ideas emerge. These ideas are unique and do not resemble the ideas from which they emerged.  
Even if the initial set of ideas seem simple and disconnected, spontaneous order can emerge, leading to brilliant ideas.
