Quoting [johnswentworth](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YABJKJ3v97k9sbxwg/what-money-cannot-buy):

> there is knowledge for which money cannot substitute.

> there is no full substitute for being an expert yourself. Heuristics about incentives can help, but theyâ€™re leaky filters at best.

> Spend time in the field, practicing the relevant skills first-hand; see both what works and what makes sense. Collect data; run trials. See what other people suggest and test those things yourself. Directly study which things actually produce good results.
