title: Some things to expect in 2025
---

Quoting [Jonathan Corbet](https://lwn.net/Articles/1003780/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter):

> There will be more cloud-based products turned to bricks by manufacturers that go bankrupt or simply stop caring. Surveillance and data-breach problems with cloud-connected products will also happen with discouraging regularity over the course of the year; see the stories on air-fryer surveillance or the Volkswagen electric-vehicle data leak for recent examples. Perhaps 2025 will be the year when awareness of the downsides of extensive cloud connectivity will become more widespread. There is an opportunity for free-software alternatives, such as Home Assistant, to make inroads by demonstrating a better way to manage personal data. Truly taking advantage of that opportunity will require a user focus that is not always our community's strong point, but one can always hope.
