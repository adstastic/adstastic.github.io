title: An Unreasonable Amount of Time
---

Quoting [Allen Pike](https://allenpike.com/2024/an-unreasonable-amount-of-time):

> Years ago, Teller performed a magic trick.1<br>First, he’d have you pick a card. He would attempt to produce the card, but fail, indicating the card may have travelled elsewhere. He’d then lead you on a short walk to a nearby park, and then be inspired to dig a hole. Buried there, beneath undisturbed grass, was a box. When opened, the box would, somehow, contain the card you’d chosen. An impossible trick.<br>To create this magical moment, he had to do something you wouldn’t expect: he’d gone out into the park and buried a number of boxes, corresponding to potential cards one might choose. Then, he waited months – until the grass had grown over. Only then could he perform the trick.<br>Deducing what card you’ve picked is a well-known sleight. But performing a trick where your card is seamlessly buried requires so much advance preparation that it seems impossible.<br>Teller describes the underlying principle like so:<br> Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect. <br>This is true of tricks, and also of crafts.<br>The pianist whose fingers seem supernaturally nimble, the presenter whose message seems viscerally compelling, and the artist whose paintings seem impossibly realistic all wield the same magic: they’ve invested more time than you’d expect.
