Quoting [Gordon Brander](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/dont-fork-the-ecosystem):

> Software can be rebuilt, because software is a machine. But a software *ecosystem* is not a machine. It is a living system. When we attempt to rebuild the *ecosystem*, weâ€™re making a category error. We confuse the software for the ecological process unfolding around it.
