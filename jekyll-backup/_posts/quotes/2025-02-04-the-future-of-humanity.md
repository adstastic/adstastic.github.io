Quoting [Jason Crawford](https://newsletter.rootsofprogress.org/p/the-future-of-humanity-is-in-management):

> what doesn’t make any sense is all of humanity starving to death from unemployment. Jobs and technology have a purpose: producing the good and services we need to live and thrive. If your model of the world includes the possibility that we would create the most advanced technology the world has ever seen, and the result would be mass starvation, then I think your model is fundamentally flawed.

> In such a world—a fully automated economy—I expect that a minority of people will still work, but only those who want to, only those for whom work is rewarding and who find it brings meaning to life (and, like a successful entrepreneur on their second act, their work won’t have to actually earn an income on any timescale). Others will do whatever is most meaningful to them: pursue knowledge and satisfy their curiosity; express their creative vision in art or music; travel and explore; spend time with family and loved ones; play games or sports. (There will always be a role for human players, because the purpose of games and sports is not to achieve a practical outcome but to experience and to witness human ability.)
