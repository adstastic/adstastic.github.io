> **Technical debt isn&#39;t always bad**

Sometimes the pragmatic solution that gets you to market faster is the right one, even if it&#39;s not technically perfect. Just be intentional about when you take on debt and when you pay it down.

> Fighting the framework creates unnecessary friction. The &#34;Rails Way&#34; exists for a reason. It allows you to focus on what makes your product unique, not reinventing solved problems.

> **Less is more**

Every gem (and JS library) adds complexity and potential points of failure. I&#39;ve learned to ask &#34;Do I really need this?&#34; before adding anything to my Gemfile.

> **Find a community**

As a solo developer, staying connected to other Rails developers is crucial. Building Spina CMS gave me a community that didn&#39;t replace having colleagues, but provided a valuable second-best for sharing ideas and learning.

> **You can go far alone**

With Rails, a single developer can build, scale and deploy a product that would normally require an entire team of developers. Don&#39;t let conventional wisdom about &#34;needing a team&#34; hold you back.
