Quoting [Alliance for Responsible Citizenship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=n__DbcXykSIZtVS8&amp;v=QSa52TR9tCA&amp;feature=youtu.be):

> if what is right and wrong depends on what each individual feels then we are outside the bounds of civilization

> I&#39;ve describ three different things we educated Elites brought you we destroy the social fabric through inequality we destroyed the moral fabric through privatizing morality and we

destroyed the institutional fabric what&#39;s happening right now

> those moments of suffering interrupt

your life and they remind you you&#39;re not the person you thought they were they carve through the floor of your basement of your soul and they reveal a cavity below and they carve through that floor and they reveal a cavity Below in moments of suffering you see yourself in a more Deep Way than you ever did before and in those moments of suffering you can either be broken or you can be broken open and people who are transformed decide I&#39;m going to be broken open and Nations that are going to be transformed by moments of suffering say we&#39;re going to be broken

open we&#39;ve been through periods of national crisis before across the world Nations have constantly hit a spiritual and cultural crisis and then revived

> we&#39;ve grown not through a happy merry ride we&#39;ve grown through a process of rupture and repair when society and culture is in crisis and we figure it out

> culture changes when a small group of people find a better way to live and the rest of us copy

> you can&#39;t create a system so perfect that the people in it don&#39;t have to be good it&#39;s when you put moral formation at the center of your society

> there isn&#39;t as much Humanity as one would like but there&#39;s enough and what you&#39;ve got to remember is that when you walk down the street every person you meet you could be that person that could be you you could be that monster you could be that Saint you could and you have to decide who you&#39;re going to be now

> defiant humanism that even in harsh and brutal times were called upon to see each other in the fullest deepest and most respectful way
